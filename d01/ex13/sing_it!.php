Yeah, yeah
Ayo, myself, it's time.
It's time, myself (aight, myself, begin).
Straight out the fat dungeons of rap.

The house drops deep as does my gouda.
I never sleep, 'cause to sleep is the mother of houdah.
Beyond the walls of pitbull, life is defined.
I think of death when I'm in a zoo state of mind.

Hope the grouse got some powerhouse.
My mouse don't like no dirty warehouse.
Run up to the blouse and get the spouse.

In a zoo state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The crazy house?
You complain about famine.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the spouse.

I'm rappin' to the fridge,
And I'm gonna move your drawbridge.

Entertaining, yummy, ugly, like a street
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a seat.

I can't take the famine, can't take the song.
I woulda tried to kill I guess I got no long.

I'm rappin' to the drawbridge,
And I'm gonna move your fridge.

Yea, yaz, in a zoo state of mind.

When I was young my mother had an eat.
I waz kicked out without no seat.
I never thought I'd see that treat.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my mother's sheet.

An useful kitchen is quite the kitchin.

Thinking of death. Yaz, thinking of death (death).
